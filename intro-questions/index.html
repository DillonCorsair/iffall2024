        <p>I'm hoping to be as well versed in the
        intersects between art/design and computer
        science. I'd like to be the most tech-savy artist
        I can to maximize my creative potential in this
        increasingly digital world. For a long time,
        I've envisioned myself working as an artist
        in the digital entertainment industry, but I'm 
        not set on a specific career direction. I'd like to keep
        as many doors open as possible, and maybe even
        create new ones. </p>

        <p>I don't have any experience in HTML/CSS/JS. </p>

    <li>
        <p>I hope to learn how to build functional (and hopefully
        appealing) documents and websites. To be more specific,
        I'm excited to learn how to manipulate color (and texture
        too?) to create impactful visuals.</p>

        <p> I expect one way that designing for a screen will 
        be different than paper is that screen designs will 
        have to be responsive to different screen dimensions.</p>

        https://www.arcane.com/en-us/
        <p> The Arcane website showcases the show's artistic flare,
            with framed clips from the show and a scroll menu that 
            transitions to different pages with paint strokes. The
            color palette is complex, but matches the colors of locations
            from the show.

        https://www.starbucks.com/menu 
        <p> The Starbucks website provides a clear breakdown of 
            its various food and drink products, as well as
            merchandise items and at-home packages. There is high
            contrast between text and background as well as between
            photograph and backdrop. A digestable number of options
            are visible at every screen as categories go from broad
            to more specific. As the user progresses through menus,
            the text and images get larger and larger to indicate
            how deep in the website one has progressed. A large 
            quantity of information is presented for each product,
            effectively broken down into drop-down menus and multiple
            choice options- all with a cohesive color palette that
            doesn't overwhelm the user. </p>

        https://www.netflix.com/browse
        <p> The Netflix website is elegently divided into horizontal 
            scroll menus that categorically display uniformly-sized thumbnails of the
            available shows and movies. So much information is displayed with
            very little text. When the user hovers over a thumbnail, it enlarges
            and more details about the option are displayed. Netflix manages to keep
            an appealing and cohesive aesthetic while displaying hundreds of possible
            selections over a range of categories and genres.
