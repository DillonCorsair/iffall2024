                <p>My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send</p>

                <p>And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'</p>
                <p>Through stressful waters to relief</p>
                <p>Yeah, oh, the things I'd do</p>
                <p>To spend a little time in Hell</p>
                <p>And what I won't tell you</p>

                <p>When you inside all day?</p>
                <p>I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain</p>
                <p>Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever</p>
